Performance review of AV1 in Literature
=========================================

Many research groups and companies have already tested and evaluated the performance of AV1. Speed of AV1 is very slow at this moment. BBC compared the efficiency between HEVC, AV1, JEM by Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and found AV1 is slightly better than HM. Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications also compare AV1, JEM, VP9, and HEVC encoders, the results show.
	 	 	
Grois, D et al.\cite{Grois2018} have compared the performance between AV1 and HEVC. Their result shows HM has better performance than AV1. On the other hand, the research of MSU Graphics \& Media Lab in 2018 has also showed that AV1 has superior performance than other codecs \cite{Dolganov2018}.
Some research also shows the performances between AV1 and HEVC have very similar\cite{Akyazi2018}.

Google also has showed the compression improvement when enabling the experimental tools. 
Nevertheless, it also shows the encoding speed is extremely slow. Sethuraman et al. \cite {Sethuraman2018} also shows AV1 has better performance than other video codecs but has very slow encoding time. Similar results are also performed by Facebook and Bitmovin.

In this section, we compare the encoding performance between AV1 and HEVC. We test the performance under 2 modes (CQ and VBR). For CQ mode, we compare it with HM. For VBR mode, we compare it with x265. The reason is explained in the following section.
