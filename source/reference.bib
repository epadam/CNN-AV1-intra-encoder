abstract = {Google started the WebM Project in 2010 to develop open source, royalty- free video codecs designed specifically for media on the Web. The second generation codec released by the WebM project, VP9, is currently served by YouTube, and enjoys billions of views per day. Realizing the need for even greater compression efficiency to cope with the growing demand for video on the web, the WebM team embarked on an ambitious project to develop a next edition codec AV1, in a consortium of major tech companies called the Alliance for Open Media, that achieves at least a generational improvement in coding efficiency over VP9. In this paper, we focus primarily on new tools in AV1 that improve the prediction of pixel blocks before transforms, quantization and entropy coding are invoked. Specifically, we describe tools and coding modes that improve intra, inter and combined inter-intra prediction. Results are presented on standard test sets.},

The proposed CfL distinguishes itself from prior art not only by reducing decoder complexity, but also by producing more accurate predictions.

abstract = {Encoders of AOM/AV1 codec consider an input video sequence as succession of frames grouped in Golden-Frame (GF) groups. The coding structure of a GF group is fixed with a given GF group size. In the current AOM/AV1 encoder, video frames are coded using a hierarchical, multilayer coding structure within one GF group. It has been observed that the use of multilayer coding structure may result in worse coding performance if the GF group presents consistent stillness across its frames. This paper proposes a new approach that adaptively designs the Golden-Frame (GF) group coding structure through the use of stillness detection. Our new approach hence develops an automatic stillness detection scheme using three metrics extracted from each GF group. It then differentiates those GF groups of stillness from other non- still GF groups and uses different GF coding structures accordingly. Experimental result demonstrates a consistent coding gain using the new approach.},

Two approaches to coding were used: (i) constant quality (QP); and (ii) target bit rate (VBR). Constant quality encoding is performed with all the three codecs for an unbiased comparison of the core coding tools. Whereas, target bitrate coding is done with the AV1 codec to study the compression efficiency achieved with rate control, which can and does have a significant impact. Performance is tabulated for on two fronts: (1) objective performance based on PSNR's and (2) informal subjective assessment. Our general conclusion derived from the assessment of objective metrics and subjective evaluation is that VVC (BMS1) appears to be superior to AV1 and HEVC under both constant quality and target bitrate coding constraints. AV1 shows superior coding gains with respect to HEVC under target bitrate coding, but in general has increased computational complexity and henceforth an encode time factor of 20 – 30 over HEVC.},

To enhance the encoding speed, GOP Level Parallelism approach is implemented on 5 slave DSP cores. A master core is reserved to manage data transfers among DSP memory and personal computer in order to perform a real-time video encoding demo taken into account video capture and bit-stream storage. Multithreading algorithm and ping pong buffers technique are used in order to optimize the communication overhead. Experimental results show that our enhanced implementation allows to overcome the real-time constraint by reaching up to 120 f/s (frame/second) for Common Intermediate Format resolution (CIF 352x288) and 35f/s for Standard Definition (SD 720x480). Our proposed approach can save about 80{\%} of run-time for High Definition resolution (HD 1280x720). The Enhanced GOP Level parallelism approach on five DSP cores achieves a good average speedup factor of 4.88 without inducing any quality degradation or bit-rate increment.},

abstract = {H.264 is a popular codec used for encoding the videos that are hosted on the video server and delivered over the internet. Achieving real time encoding still remains a challenging problem. A possible solution to minimize the encoding time would be to develop applications with high level of Thread-Level Parallelism (TLP) to exploit the power of multi-core processors. Parallelization strategies at various levels such as Macro-block level, slice level, frame level have been proposed by various authors. Most of these techniques suffer from the drawbacks of limited scalability, and data dependency. We propose in this paper, a high level parallelization method based on Group-Of-Pictures (GOP). In this method, each GOP will be encoded independently and the frames being referenced are included within the GOP. In GOP-level parallelism, openMP programming model is used to restructure the H.264 encoder. This is to exploit the capability of the available hardware resources to support concurrent processing. The results obtained show that the strategy implemented provides high level of parallelism and efficiently exploits the capabilities of the multi-core system. The speedup achieved using the proposed method is 5.6 to 10 times higher compared to a well-optimized sequential code implementation.},

abstract = {Since the emergence of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as a prominent technique in the field of computer vision, the ImageNet classification challenge has played a major role in advancing the state-of-the-art. While accuracy figures have steadily increased, the resource utilization of winning models has not been properly taken into account. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of important metrics in practical applications: accuracy, memory footprint, parameters, operations count, inference time and power consumption. Key findings are: (1) power consumption is independent of batch size and architecture; (2) accuracy and inference time are in a hyperbolic relationship; (3) energy constraint is an upper bound on the maximum achievable accuracy and model complexity; (4) the number of operations is a reliable estimate of the inference time. We believe our analysis provides a compelling set of information that helps design and engineer efficient DNNs.},

The in-loop filter is based on a non-linear low-pass filter and is designed for vectorization efficiency. It takes into account the direction of edges and patterns being filtered. The filter works by identifying the direction of each block and then adaptively filtering with a high degree of control over the filter strength along the direction and across it. The proposed enhancement filter is shown to improve the quality of the Alliance for Open Media (AOM) AV1 and Thor video codecs in particular in low complexity configurations.},

@inproceedings{DeCock2016,
abstract = {Over the last years, we have seen exciting improvements in video compression technology, due to the introduction of HEVC and royalty-free coding specifications such as VP9. The potential compression gains of HEVC over H.264/AVC have been demonstrated in different studies, and are usually based on the HM reference software. For VP9, substantial gains over H.264/AVC have been reported in some publications, whereas others reported less optimistic results. Differences in configurations between these publications make it more difficult to assess the true potential of VP9. Practical open-source encoder implementations such as x265 and libvpx (VP9) have matured, and are now showing high compression gains over x264. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of these encoder imple- mentations, with settings optimized for non-real-time random access, as used in a video-on-demand encoding pipeline. We report results from a large-scale video codec comparison test, which includes x264, x265 and libvpx. A test set consisting of a variety of titles with varying spatio-temporal characteristics from our catalog is used, resulting in tens of millions of encoded frames, hence larger than test sets previously used in the literature. Re- sults are reported in terms of PSNR, SSIM, MS-SSIM, VIF and the recently introduced VMAF quality metric. BD-rate calculations show that using x265 and libvpx vs. x264 can lead to significant bitrate savings for the same quality. x265 outperforms libvpx in most cases, but the performance gap narrows (or even reverses) at the higher resolutions.},

abstract = {Current increasing effort of broadcast providers to transmit UHD (Ultra High Definition) content is likely to increase demand for ultra high definition televisions (UHDTVs). To compress UHDTV content, several alternative encoding mechanisms exist. In addition to internationally recognized standards, open access proprietary options, such as VP9 video encoding scheme, have recently appeared and are gaining popularity. One of the main goals of these encoders is to efficiently compress video sequences beyond HDTV resolution for various scenarios, such as broadcasting or internet streaming. In this paper, a broadcast scenario rate-distortion performance analysis and mutual comparison of one of the latest video coding standards H.265/HEVC with recently released proprietary video coding scheme VP9 is presented. Also, currently one of the most popular and widely spread encoder H.264/AVC has been included into the evaluation to serve as a comparison baseline. The comparison is performed by means of subjective evaluations showing actual differences between encoding algorithms in terms of perceived quality. The results indicate a general dominance of HEVC based encoding algorithm in comparison to other alternatives, while VP9 and AVC showing similar performance.},

The second generation codec released by the WebM project, VP9, is currently served by YouTube, and enjoys billions of views per day. Realizing the need for even greater compression efficiency to cope with the growing demand for video on the web, the WebM team embarked on an ambitious project to develop a next edition codec AV1, in a consortium of major tech companies called the Alliance for Open Media, that achieves at least a generational improvement in coding efficiency over VP9. In this paper, we focus primarily on new tools in AV1 that improve the prediction of pixel blocks before transforms, quantization and entropy coding are invoked. Specifically, we describe tools and coding modes that improve intra, inter and combined inter-intra prediction. Results are presented on standard test sets.},
